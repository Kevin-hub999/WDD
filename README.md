# WDD project (Website Design and Development)
> First introduction to programming.

The project has engage the concept of manifesting the design of a website and executing it with literal programming languages.
In this project, the website has been assembled after several consideration of process into creating a website.

## What I have done
- Acquired Concepts of Java Library
- Developed sample prototype of the website
- Implemented a single-page website from prototype

## Language Applied
- Jquery
- Ajax
- Balsamiq mockup

### Project Description
This project was mainly targeted to introduce to the students to be able to understand the stages of implementing a website. The website was about a training center that desires to provide
- class details
- time-table.

I have been introduced to Information Architecture and prototypes to implement the website, and it was necessary to develop one. And then the vision was implemented into reality with Jquery and Ajax.


### Prototype
Firstly, this prototype has been implemented with balsamiq mockup in order to make it appealing to the students.
