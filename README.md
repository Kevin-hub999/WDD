- Balsamiq mockup

### Project Description
This project was mainly targeted to introduce to the students to be able to understand the stages of implementing a website. The website was about a training center that desires to provide

- time-table.

I have been introduced to Information Architecture and prototypes to implement the website, and it was necessary to develop one. And then the vision was implemented into reality with Jquery and Ajax.
